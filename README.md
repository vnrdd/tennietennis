## About
TennieTennis — the game that has a lot of game mods. It has singleplayer section and multiplayer section. Lets discover each one in details.

## Game Mods
### Singleplayer

In this section we have two game submods: Squash Mod and Play With Bot Mod.
* **Squash Mod**. Here is only you and a ball situated on the pitch. So you play against borders and your goal is to not allow the ball touches the wall behind you. 
For each bounce you get 1 point.

* **Play With Bot**. In this mod you play against bot. Bot has 2 difficulty levels. Player gets a point if the ball touches the opponent's wall. The game lasts until the score 
reached the win border (5/10/15) — you can choose it in Settings.
